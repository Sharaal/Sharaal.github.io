In einer gemeinsamen Ankündigung mit OpenAI-CEO Sam Altman wurde bekannt gegeben, dass Ive und sein Designstudio LoveFrom eine zentrale Rolle bei der Entwicklung neuer KI-basierter Geräte übernehmen werden. Die Partnerschaft, die auf einen Wert von 6,5 Milliarden US-Dollar geschätzt wird, markiert einen bedeutenden Schritt in der Integration von Design und künstlicher Intelligenz.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIve, der für ikonische Apple-Produkte wie das iPhone und den iPod verantwortlich war, erklärte, dass er sich von der Vision und den Werten von OpenAI inspiriert fühle. „Alles, was ich in den letzten 30 Jahren gelernt habe, hat mich zu diesem Moment geführt“, sagte Ive in einem Interview. Ziel der Zusammenarbeit ist es, ein revolutionäres KI-Gerät zu entwickeln, das die Art und Weise, wie Menschen mit Technologie interagieren, grundlegend verändern soll. Erste Prototypen sollen bereits existieren, und die Markteinführung ist für 2026 geplant.\n\nDie Partnerschaft kommt zu einem Zeitpunkt, an dem Technologieunternehmen weltweit verstärkt auf KI setzen. OpenAI hat in den letzten Jahren nicht nur mit ChatGPT, sondern auch mit anderen KI-Innovationen für Aufsehen gesorgt. Mit Ive an Bord will das Unternehmen nun den nächsten Schritt gehen und KI in physische Produkte integrieren, die über die bisherigen Möglichkeiten von Smartphones hinausgehen. Details zu den geplanten Geräten sind noch spärlich, doch Insider sprechen von einer „bildschirmlosen, KI-zentrierten Technologie“, die den Fokus auf eine nahtlose und intuitive Nutzererfahrung legt.\n\n### Quellen\n- [OpenAI Teams Up with Jony Ive to Build New AI Device](https://connectcx.ai/jony-ive-and-openai-teams-up-to-build-new-ai-device/)\n- [Billion-euro deal: Ex-Apple design boss Jony Ive and OpenAI join forces](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Billion-euro-deal-Ex-Apple-design-boss-Jony-Ive-and-OpenAI-join-forces-10392150.html)\n- [Welcome to io: OpenAI acquires Jony Ive's secret startup](https://www.wallpaper.com/tech/welcome-to-io-openai-acquires-jony-ives-secret-startup-to-shape-the-form-of-future-ai)",
