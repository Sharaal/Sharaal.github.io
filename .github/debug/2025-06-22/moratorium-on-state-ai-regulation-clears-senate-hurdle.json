Opponents call it a dangerous giveaway to tech firms that would leave consumers — particularly vulnerable communities and children — unprotected and wipe out a flurry of state laws that address everything from deepfakes to discrimination in automated hiring.\n\nNow, the bill advances to the Senate, where its fate is deeply uncertain. Democratic lawmakers are expected to challenge House Republicans’ inclusion of the AI moratorium in the reconciliation package under what’s known as [the Byrd Rule](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/RL30862), which prohibits the inclusion of provisions that are “extraneous” to the federal budget in the reconciliation process.\n\nHouse Republicans tucked the measure into a section ordering the Commerce Department to deploy funds to “modernize and secure Federal information technology systems through the deployment of commercial artificial intelligence.” The measure has remained [largely unchanged](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/RU/RU00/20250521/118300/BILLS-1194rh.pdf) since its consideration by the House Energy and Commerce Committee [earlier this month](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF00/20250513/118261/HMKP-119-IF00-20250513-SD003.pdf), though lawmakers on the House Committee on Rules recently added an exemption so that the moratorium would not apply to the enforcement of any law that “carries a criminal penalty.”\n\nWidely rejected by Democrats, the push is also facing opposition from some Senate Republicans, who would largely need to unite on the legislation to get it passed. At a Senate hearing Wednesday, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) [poured cold water on the idea](https://x.com/zamaan_qureshi/status/1925320843787112460), expressing concern that the bill would override legislation to protect artists from deepfakes in her state.\n\n“Speaking to the states and their actions, I do want to mention that Tennessee passed the ELVIS Act, which is like our first generation of the NO FAKES Act,” said Blackburn, “And we certainly know that, in Tennessee, we need those protections, and until we pass something that is federally preemptive, we can't call for a moratorium on those things.”\n\n#### Our Content delivered to your inbox.\n\nJoin our newsletter on issues and ideas at the intersection of tech & democracy\n\nSubscribe\n\nLoading...\n\n#### Thank you!\n\nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has also pushed back on the proposal, [according to Punchbowl](https://punchbowl.news/archive/51825-tech-sunday-lookahead/).\n\nThe measure was debated at a House [subcommittee hearing](https://www.techpolicy.press/transcript-us-house-subcommittee-hosts-hearing-on-ai-regulation-and-the-future-of-us-leadership/) Wednesday after it [advanced](https://www.techpolicy.press/us-house-committee-advances-10-year-moratorium-on-state-ai-regulation/) out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee last week.\n\n“A patchwork of various state laws is not good for innovation, for business or consumers, and that is what we’re trying to avoid,” Rep. Russ Fulcher (R-IN) said Wednesday.\n\n“Make no mistake, the families who have come to this committee and begged for us to act won't benefit from this proposal,” said Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA) added at the subcommittee hearing. “But you know who will? The Big Tech CEOs who are sitting behind Donald Trump at his",

TCAI has full coverage, including the full text of the amendment, available_ [_here_](/news/in-congress-new-version-of-state-ai-law-ban-tied-to-broadband-funding)_._\n\nJune 9, 2025 update:\n\nSenate Republicans offer amendment tying 10-year AI ban to federal funding for state broadband programs. Click image for full story.\n\nJune 4, 2025 — As the federal budget bill continues to be discussed in the U.S. Senate, more members of Congress and the public have become aware of a powerful non-budgetary clause inserted within it: A ten-year moratorium on all state and local laws related to artificial intelligence.\n\nAt the Transparency Coalition we are alarmed by the dramatic overreach of this proposal. Artificial intelligence is many things: An evolving technology, a burgeoning industry, and a powerful tool. Above all it is a technology that requires good-faith discussion, healthy policy debate, and governance that encourages innovation while guiding the technology to benefit society and minimize harm.\n\nWe welcome that discussion on both the state and federal level with interested members of both parties.\n\nThe proposed budget-bill clause would profoundly undermine the healthy discussion and policymaking currently taking place at the state level. The [letter](/news/bipartisan-lawmakers-from-50-states-tell-congress-dont-stop-us-from-acting-on-ai) released yesterday, signed by 260 Republican state lawmakers, 259 Democratic state lawmakers, and one Independent state legislator, attests to the bipartisan determination to get it right when it comes to the appropriate governance of AI.\n\nIn the interest of spreading accurate information about the proposed 10-year moratorium, we’ve created this resource page to bring daylight to this pressing issue.\n\n#### where the proposal can be found\n\nThe proposed federal budget is a massive document that runs to 1,038 pages.\n\nThe proposed moratorium can be found within _TITLE IV - ENERGY AND COMMERCE, Subtitle C - Communications, Part 2 - Artificial Intelligence and Information Technology Modernization._\n\nWithin the full budget document, available below, it’s easiest to find by searching for Sec. 43201. It is located on page 277.\n\n#### full budget, as approved by the House, available below\n\nThis is the latest version of the [budget bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text), as approved by the House on May 22, 2025:\n\n[\n\n](/s/Budget-Bill-approved-by-House-May-2025.pdf)\n\n_Click on image to access the full budget._\n\n#### full text of the proposed moratorium\n\nThe moratorium begins at Section 8(c) below:\n\n> _Subtitle C—Communications_\n> \n> _PART 2—ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION_\n> \n> _SEC. 43201. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION INITIATIVE._\n> \n> _8 (a) APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS.—There is hereby appropriated to the Department of Commerce for fiscal year 2025, out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $500,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2034, to modernize and secure Federal infor1mation technology systems through the deployment of commercial artificial intelligence, the deployment of automation technologies, and the replacement of antiquated business systems in accordance with subsection (b)._\n> \n> _(b) AUTHORIZED USES.—The Secretary of Commerce shall use the funds appropriated under subsection(a) for the following:_\n> \n> _(1) To replace or modernize",

Die Regelung, die Teil eines umfassenden Gesetzespakets ist, sieht ein zehnjähriges Moratorium für die Durchsetzung von staatlichen und lokalen KI-Gesetzen vor. Diese Maßnahme wurde von der Vorsitzenden des Senatsausschusses für Handel, Ted Cruz, unterstützt und zielt darauf ab, ein Flickwerk von staatlichen KI-Vorschriften zu vermeiden, das die Innovation behindern könnte.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nDie Entscheidung des Senatsparlamentariers, diese Bestimmung in das Gesetzespaket aufzunehmen, bedeutet, dass sie nicht der 60-Stimmen-Hürde im Senat unterliegt. Dies ist ein bedeutender Schritt, da die Regelung nun im Rahmen des Versöhnungsverfahrens weiterverfolgt werden kann, das nur eine einfache Mehrheit erfordert. Befürworter argumentieren, dass das Moratorium den Unternehmen Zeit geben würde, sich an einheitliche Bundesvorschriften anzupassen, während Kritiker befürchten, dass es den Verbraucherschutz schwächen und die Macht der großen Technologieunternehmen stärken könnte.\n\nDie Maßnahme hat bereits erhebliche Gegenwehr erfahren, sowohl von Demokraten als auch von einigen Republikanern. Gegner argumentieren, dass das Moratorium ein gefährliches Zugeständnis an die Technologiebranche darstellt und die Verbraucher, insbesondere gefährdete Gemeinschaften und Kinder, ungeschützt lässt. Einige Bundesstaaten haben bereits Gesetze erlassen, die sich mit Themen wie algorithmischer Voreingenommenheit und Deepfakes befassen, und diese könnten durch das Moratorium außer Kraft gesetzt werden.\n\nDie Zukunft des Moratoriums bleibt ungewiss, da es nun im Senat weiter diskutiert wird. Einige Republikaner haben Bedenken geäußert, dass die Regelung die Rechte der Bundesstaaten untergräbt und die Durchsetzung wichtiger Schutzmaßnahmen verhindert. Die Debatte über die richtige Balance zwischen bundesstaatlicher und bundesweiter Regulierung von KI wird voraussichtlich weitergehen, während der Gesetzgebungsprozess voranschreitet.\n\n### Quellen\n- [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/22/moratorium-on-state-ai-regulation-clears-senate-hurdle/)\n- [POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/22/senate-parliamentarian-greenlights-state-ai-law-freeze-in-gop-megabill-00416499)\n- [Axios](https://www.axios.com/pro/tech-policy/2025/06/22/senate-parliamentarian-greenlights-ai-moratorium)\n- [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/ai-regulation-state-moratorium-congress-78d24dea621f5c1f8bc947e86667b65d)\n- [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/politics/681727/ro-khanna-ai-state-law-moratorium-reconciliation)",
