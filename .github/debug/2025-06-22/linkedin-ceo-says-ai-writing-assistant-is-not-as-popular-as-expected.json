As LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky suggests, users have been rather reluctant to turn to the platform's AI writer when it comes to set their posts.\n\n“Not As Popular As I Thought,” Admits CEO\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Roslansky candidly shared his surprise at the feature's lukewarm reception.\n\n“It’s not as popular as I thought it would be, quite frankly,” he said.\n\nRoslansky believes the hesitation stems from the high-stakes nature of LinkedIn itself. “This is your resume online,” he said, explaining that users fear reputational damage if caught posting AI-written content.\n\n**ALSO READ:** **[Why Your AC Needs A Second Service This Summer As Heatwave Rises](https://www.thedailyjagran.com/technology/why-your-ac-needs-a-second-service-this-summer-as-heatwave-rises-10247096 \"Why Your AC Needs A Second Service This Summer As Heatwave Rises\")**\n\n“If you’re getting called out on X or TikTok, that’s one thing. But when you’re getting called out on LinkedIn, it impacts your ability to create economic opportunity for yourself,” he added.\n\nAI Skills Still in High Demand\n------------------------------\n\nDespite reluctance around content creation, interest in pursuing AI careers has risen substantially as a result. Over the last year alone, LinkedIn has reported an astonishing six-fold rise in job postings requiring AI proficiency. Users are also eager to display newfound skills, with 20 times more adding AI expertise to their profiles.\n\nThe trends suggest that while users may not trust AI to speak for them publicly, they are embracing it professionally.\n\nEven LinkedIn’s CEO Uses Copilot\n--------------------------------\n\nLinkedIn's CEO made a statement saying that he uses Microsoft's Copilot AI not only to draft messages but also when composing emails to Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella.\n\n**ALSO READ: [Use Siri For Talking To ChatGPT On iPhone And Mac: Simple Setup Guide Inside](https://www.thedailyjagran.com/technology/use-siri-to-talk-to-chatgpt-on-iphone-and-mac-simple-setup-guide-inside-10247021 \"Use Siri For Talking To ChatGPT On iPhone And Mac: Simple Setup Guide Inside \")**\n\n“Every time, before I send him an email, I hit the Copilot button to make sure that I sound Satya-smart,” he joked.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIt appears that LinkedIn users are sceptical about using AI to help them write posts due to concerns over being perceived as trying too hard and damaging their professional reputation. Still, these professionals are eager to utilise and master the emerging skills associated with AI tech.\n\n[](/)\n\nConnect, share, thrive together.\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheDailyJagran)[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thedailyjagran?igsh=cHk5MWI4OHg0NXFs)[X](https://x.com/TheDailyJagran)[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@thedailyjagran)\n\n*   [Jagran Hindi](https://www.jagran.com \"Jagran Hindi\")\n*   [Punjabi Jagran](https://www.punjabijagran.com \"Punjabi Jagran\")\n*   [Gujarati Jagran](https://www.gujaratijagran.com \"Gujarati Jagran\")\n*   [Nai Dunia](https://www.naidunia.com/ \"Nai Dunia\")\n*   [Inextlive](https://www.inextlive.com/ \"Inextlive\")\n*   [Jagran Jos",

In the evolving landscape of digital communication, [AI continues to reshape how we interact](https://mischadohler.com/ais-college-application-revolution-how-technology-transforms-your-search-for-the-perfect-school/), and LinkedIn is no exception.\n\nAs a tech enthusiast who’s navigated countless professional platforms, I recall the days when crafting the perfect LinkedIn post felt like writing a doctoral thesis – meticulous, time-consuming, and nerve-wracking.\n\nLinkedIn’s AI Writing Assistant: The Unexpected Truth\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nLinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky recently revealed surprising insights about the platform’s AI writing assistant. Despite expectations, the feature hasn’t gained the anticipated traction. [The tool designed to polish posts isn’t as popular as initially thought](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/22/linkedin-ceo-says-ai-writing-assistant-is-not-as-popular-as-expected/).\n\nRoslansky candidly explained that the barrier to posting on LinkedIn is significantly higher than other platforms. Users recognize this space as their professional digital resume, making them more cautious about AI-generated content. The potential professional reputation risk of being identified as using AI-generated text creates hesitation.\n\nInterestingly, while the writing assistant struggles, LinkedIn has witnessed remarkable AI-related growth. The platform has experienced a 6x increase in jobs requiring AI skills and a 20x surge in users adding AI capabilities to their profiles. This paradox highlights the nuanced relationship professionals have with AI technology.\n\nThe CEO himself leverages AI, using Microsoft’s Copilot before sending emails to his boss, Satya Nadella, demonstrating a strategic approach to AI integration. This personal anecdote underscores the potential of AI tools when used judiciously.\n\nLinkedIn AI Enhancement Platform\n--------------------------------\n\nImagine a startup that develops a nuanced AI writing assistant specifically designed for professional networking. The platform would offer contextual, industry-specific writing suggestions that maintain individual voice authenticity. By integrating advanced natural language processing and understanding professional tone variations, this service would help users craft compelling, personalized content while mitigating AI detection risks.\n\nNavigating the AI Professional Landscape\n----------------------------------------\n\nAre you ready to embrace AI responsibly in your professional journey? The key lies in understanding AI as a tool, not a replacement. How will you leverage these technologies to enhance, not replace, your unique professional voice?\n\n* * *\n\nLinkedIn AI FAQ\n---------------\n\n**Q1: Is LinkedIn’s AI writing assistant free?**  \nA: Currently available to select users, with potential broader rollout pending user feedback.\n\n**Q2: Can AI-generated content harm my professional reputation?**  \nA: Potential risks exist if content appears obviously machine-generated.\n\n**Q3: How many LinkedIn jobs require AI skills?**  \nA: LinkedIn reports a 6x increase in AI-related job postings.\n\nPost navigation\n===============\n\n[← AI’s College Application Revolution: How Technology Transforms Your Search for the Perfect School](https://mischadohler.com/ais-college-application-revolution-how-te",

The introduction of automated prose can sometimes change a website’s character, like when once beloved publications get purchased and overhauled into [AI content mills](https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-hairpin-blog-ai-clickbait-farm/). Other times, however, it’s harder to argue that AI really changed anything. For example, look at LinkedIn.\n\nThe Microsoft-owned social media site for business professionals has [embraced AI](https://www.wired.com/story/linkedin-turns-20-ai-push/), even offering LinkedIn Premium subscribers access to its own in-house AI writing tools that can “rewrite” posts, profiles, and direct messages. The initiative appears to be working: Over 54 percent of longer English-language posts on LinkedIn are likely AI-generated, according to a new analysis shared exclusively with WIRED by the AI detection startup Originality AI. It’s just that the corporate-speak style of AI writing on the platform can be tricky to distinguish from genuine human-penned [Thought Leader Blogging](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/).\n\nOriginality scanned a sample of 8,795 public LinkedIn posts over 100 words long that were published from January 2018 to October 2024. For the first few years, the use of AI writing tools on LinkedIn was negligible. A major increase then occurred at the beginning of 2023. “The uptick happened when ChatGPT came out,” says Originality CEO Jon Gillham. At that point, Originality found the number of likely AI-generated posts had spiked 189 percent; it has since leveled off.\n\nLinkedIn says it doesn’t track how many posts on the site are written or edited with AI tools. “But we do have robust defenses in place to proactively identify low-quality, and exact or near-exact duplicate content. When we detect such content, we take action to ensure it is not broadly promoted,” says Adam Walkiewicz, LinkedIn’s head of “feed relevance.” “We see AI as a tool that can help with review of a draft or to beat the blank page problem, but the original thoughts and ideas that our members share are what matter.”\n\nLinkedIn is for finding a new job and keeping in touch with former coworkers, which means it’s a relatively staid social media platform. But in recent years, it’s developed its own network of [influencers](https://www.fastcompany.com/91192383/how-linkedin-became-influencers-hot-new-video-platform) and is [surprisingly popular](https://www.axios.com/2023/08/24/linkedin-popular-social-media) with Gen Z, including [teenagers](https://www.thecut.com/article/why-teenagers-love-linkedin.html). Like everywhere else on the internet, people are thirsty for attention on LinkedIn, too, and startups have realized there’s money to be made helping people grow th",

          "content": "LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky recently revealed that the platform's AI writing assistant has not gained the expected popularity among users. Despite the general enthusiasm for AI technologies, LinkedIn members have shown reluctance to use AI-generated post suggestions. Roslansky expressed his surprise in an interview with Bloomberg, stating, \"It’s not as popular as I thought it would be, quite frankly.\" He attributed this hesitation to the high-stakes nature of LinkedIn, where users are cautious about their professional reputation and fear potential backlash from using AI-generated content【2-0】【2-1】【2-2】.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe CEO noted that while users are hesitant to use AI for public posts, there has been a significant increase in the demand for AI skills on the platform. Over the past year, LinkedIn has seen a six-fold rise in job postings requiring AI proficiency and a twenty-fold increase in users adding AI expertise to their profiles. This trend suggests that while professionals are wary of AI-generated content, they are eager to learn and showcase AI-related skills. Roslansky himself uses Microsoft's Copilot AI to draft messages and emails, highlighting the potential of AI tools when used strategically【2-0】【2-1】【2-4】.\n\nThe reluctance to adopt the AI writing assistant is primarily due to concerns over professional credibility. Users fear that AI-generated posts might be perceived as inauthentic, which could harm their reputation and career opportunities. This is particularly significant on LinkedIn, where the platform serves as a digital resume and a space for professional networking. The potential for reputational damage is much higher compared to other social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) or TikTok, where the stakes are lower【2-0】【2-4】.\n\nDespite these challenges, the integration of AI into professional workflows continues to grow. LinkedIn's experience with its AI writing assistant highlights the nuanced relationship between professionals and AI technology. While there is a clear interest in AI skills and tools, the application of these technologies in public professional spaces requires careful consideration to maintain authenticity and trust【2-0】【2-1】【2-4】.\n\n### Sources\n- [The Daily Jagran](https://www.thedailyjagran.com/technology/linkedin-users-shy-away-from-ai-writing-tools-says-ceo-ryan-roslansky-10247117)\n- [Mischa Dohler](https://mischadohler.com/linkedin-the-surprising-reality-behind-its-unpopular-ai-writing-assistant/)\n- [DigiTrendz](https://digitrendz.blog/newswire/artificial-intelligence/19170/linkedin-ceo-ai-writing-assistant-falls-short-of-expectations/)\n- [Topmost Ads](https://topmostads.com/linkedin-ai-writing-assistant-adoption-challenges/)\n- [Wirefan](https://www.wirefan.com/2025/06/linkedin-ceo-says-ai-writing-assistant-is-not-as-popular-as-expected/)",
