LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky recently revealed that the platform's AI writing assistant has not gained the expected popularity among users. Despite the general enthusiasm for AI technologies, LinkedIn members have shown reluctance to use AI-generated post suggestions. Roslansky expressed his surprise in an interview with Bloomberg, stating, "It"s not as popular as I thought it would be, quite frankly." He attributed this hesitation to the high-stakes nature of LinkedIn, where users are cautious about their professional reputation and fear potential backlash from using AI-generated content.

The CEO noted that while users are hesitant to use AI for public posts, there has been a significant increase in the demand for AI skills on the platform. Over the past year, LinkedIn has seen a six-fold rise in job postings requiring AI proficiency and a twenty-fold increase in users adding AI expertise to their profiles. This trend suggests that while professionals are wary of AI-generated content, they are eager to learn and showcase AI-related skills. Roslansky himself uses Microsoft's Copilot AI to draft messages and emails, highlighting the potential of AI tools when used strategically.

The reluctance to adopt the AI writing assistant is primarily due to concerns over professional credibility. Users fear that AI-generated posts might be perceived as inauthentic, which could harm their reputation and career opportunities. This is particularly significant on LinkedIn, where the platform serves as a digital resume and a space for professional networking. The potential for reputational damage is much higher compared to other social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) or TikTok, where the stakes are lower.

Despite these challenges, the integration of AI into professional workflows continues to grow. LinkedIn's experience with its AI writing assistant highlights the nuanced relationship between professionals and AI technology. While there is a clear interest in AI skills and tools, the application of these technologies in public professional spaces requires careful consideration to maintain authenticity and trust.
